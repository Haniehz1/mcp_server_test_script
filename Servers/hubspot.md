# HubSpot MCP Server Reference

## Overview

The HubSpot MCP server connects to HubSpot CRM APIs to retrieve and manage CRM data (contacts, companies, deals) for agent workflows.

**Use for:** Accessing HubSpot CRM records and running CRM-related operations via MCP tools. Supports read-only access to contacts, companies, deals, tickets, carts, products, orders, line items, invoices, quotes, subscriptions, users, and owners (subject to scopes and user permissions).

## Configuration

hubspot:
   - Description: Interacts with HubSpot CRM APIs.
   - Info URL: `https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/developer-platform/build-apps/integrate-with-hubspot-mcp-server`
   - Transport Type: streamable_http
   - Configuration:
   ```yaml
   hubspot:
      transport: streamable_http
      url: "https://mcp.hubspot.com/"
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer ${HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
        X-HubSpot-ClientId: "${HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID}"
   ```
   - Secrets:
   ```yaml
    mcp.servers.hubspot.headers.Authorization: Bearer token generated by the OAuth install flow, with "Bearer" prefix
    mcp.servers.hubspot.headers.X-HubSpot-ClientId: HubSpot app client ID
   ```

## Manual Setup

1) **Create a user-level OAuth app (marketplace distribution) on the latest HubSpot developer platform (2025.2+).
** Configure:
   - `distribution: marketplace`
   - `auth.type: oauth`, `isUserLevel: true`
   - Redirect URLs (e.g., http://localhost:3000/oauth-callback)
   - Required scopes: include `oauth`, `crm.objects.contacts.read`, `crm.objects.companies.read`, `crm.objects.tickets.read` (add additional CRM read scopes as needed, e.g., deals, products, orders, line items, invoices, quotes, subscriptions, users, owners).

2) **Upload the app (`hs project upload`) and add any additional CRM read scopes** your use case requires, then re-upload.

3) **Install the app via its OAuth install URL** (per-user install). Complete the install flow to obtain:
   - Access token (Bearer) and refresh token
   - App client ID



5) **Set secrets** for the MCP server:
   - `mcp.servers.hubspot.headers.Authorization`: `Bearer <access_token>`
   - `mcp.servers.hubspot.headers.X-HubSpot-ClientId`: `<client_id>`
